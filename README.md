### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. my name is ali(or coding_eagle) and I am a full-stack web developer and I'm based in turkey. my passion towards programming started when I was 16. but I didn't have the chance to really try it. I started to learn programming non-stop from when I was 18 until today (roughly 3 years). these are some of the technologies that I've worked with a lot:

- php
- mysql
- firebase
- javascript
- vuejs
- react
- nodejs
- express
- mongodb
